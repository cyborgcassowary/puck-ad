Why do you never cry?
Why don't you ever try?
Why don't you ever die?
When will this blood dry?



Cut you like the whore you are
In my eyes you're my star
X-Rated film okay
Let's do this before you decay


Questions asked are never answered
Your hollow stares black as cancer
Love you faster than a meth sack's lurk
So deeply vast I can not ignore



Cut you like the whore you are
In my eyes you're my star
X-Rated film okay
Let's do this before you decay


High on the basement rafters babe
As you're dancing in the faint moonlight
Twirling on the meat hook babe
You're so pretty hung you're out of sight


Some people find horror in this
So beautiful when you don't resist
A pretty face, here's a kiss
You won't be going back home to Memphis
